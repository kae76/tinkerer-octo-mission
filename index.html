<a name="Summary" class="anchor" href="#summary"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>
Summary</h2>

<p>My Drupal strengths are in Site Building with the usual supplementary skills: VM management, command line-y when required (oh-my-zsh is AMAZING), issue queue hawker, Sublime text 2 lover, documentation maniac, scrum master neurosis, light theme tweakery... to list a few.</p>

<p>I like finding elegant solutions to problems; solutions which are repeatable and achieved simply with little effort! Automagically is a state of being ~ Zen is more than a theme…</p>

<p>I’m currently working on a MBP, have worked with Ubuntu, Windows, prefer anything that makes life simple and… is Ubuntu  ;-) oh and of course I've jumped on the Raspberry Pi bandwagon.</p>

<p>Recently fallen in love with Vagrant – though I’m still learning the weird ways of the headless VM.</p>

<p>I've had a varied career - mostly oscillating between; Art, Design, Technology, Education.<br>
  Learning new things drives me; I'm inspired by communities, social change, long hikes, and  … quite like a cup of tea. Aside to doing all of the above for work/play etc I also love photography, Taiji, Yoga, hiking, reading... not all at same time.</p>
